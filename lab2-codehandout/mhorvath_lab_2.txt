sendToAllServers() ensures that all messages for a given UUID are sent before 
any messages for a different UUID are sent. This is accomplished by locking the
proxy's serverLock before it can send to any servers. 

Additionally, each call to beginChangeBalance() or beginReadBalance() must
return immediately, or else throw a NoConnectionException which is then used to
invalidate the server and remove it from the membership group. This ensures that
all servers that remain a part of the membership group successfully received the
message for UUID u before any receive the message for UUID u + 1.
